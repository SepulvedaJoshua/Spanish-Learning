# Subjects

```bash
Soy un(a) estudiante

I'm a student
```

* "Soy" is a To Be verb, it's literally \(i am\). 
* "Un\(a\)" depends of your gender, "Un" is for a male student, and "Una" is for a female student
* You can also leave this sentence in "neutral" gender just removing  the "Un\(a\)", in this case would be "Soy estudiante" \(i'm a student\)
* In some cases, the adjective contains the gender like "Enfermera" \(Nurse\) or "Carpintero" \(Carpenter\).

* Doctor is also used when you're going to the doctor, as like in English, for example "Voy al doctor".
