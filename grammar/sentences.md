# Sentences

## Positive

There are many ways to say a positive to be sentence, you can extend it or do it shorter if you use the correct words.

Spanish is very weird in this cases, because you can say the same adding or removing some words.  
Here's an example  
  
_Yo soy un desarrollador / Soy un desarrollador / Soy desarrollador / Yo soy desarrollador._

This sentences means the same \(i'm a Developer\), this happens because many words are unnecessary but it works as well. in this case "Yo" and "Soy" refers to yourself, so you can use both of them or just one, "Un" it's like an "a", but "Yo" and "Soy" are plural so, it's also not necessary to say it. All this words are correct and it is up to you to choose the one that best suits you. By the way, i think the shorter, and correct is "Soy desarrollador".

Other examples:  
- Soy oficinista \(i'm an office worker\)  
- Soy programadora \(I'm a programmer\)

Notes: In this two cases we use "Oficinista" and "Programadora". I chose these two because the first \(Oficinista\) is a non-gender adjective, so if you want to specify you can add a "Un/Una" \(Soy una oficinista\).  
And in the second example, we use "Programadora". This word is female gender, so you don't have to specify your gender with a subject, by the way you can do it as well like "Soy una programadora".

## Negative

Generally, negative sentences works as well as positive sentences, but you have to add a negative indicator.

_Yo **no** soy un desarrollador / **No** soy un desarrollador / **No** soy desarrollador / Yo **no** soy desarrollador._

NOTE: Don't worry about studying all different forms to say the sentence, just pick one that suits you and work with it \(same with positive form\).
