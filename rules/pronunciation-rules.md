# Pronunciation Rules

## "R" Fuerte y "R" Suave \(Strong "R" and Soft "R"\)

"R fuerte" is a phoneme strongly used in Spanish, to pronounce it, you have to move your tongue back, stick it to the upper palate and blow, we also reference it grammatically with "erre / erres \(plural\)".  
  
You use R Fuerte when one of the following rules is met:

* The word starts with R \(Ex: Ratón\)
* The word has 2 Rs \(Ex: Desarrollar\)
* The R comes after an N \(-nr-\), L \(-lr-\) or S \(-sr-\)
  * Examples: So**nr**isa \(Smile\), A**lr**ededor \(Around\), Di**sr**upción \(disruption\).

"R suave" is more easily to say, because you don't really have to force your tongue with this, also sounds very similar to ら、り、る、れ、ろ.   
  
Soft R is practically used when none of the R Strong rules are met, anyways, here's his rules:

* The R is at the end \(Ex: Parar -&gt; Stop\).
* The R has -ere-, -oro-, -iri-, -ara-, -uru- or some combinations or the above \(-iru-, -eru-, etc.\).
  * Examples: Loro \(Parrot\), Lámpara \(Lamp\), Pera \(Pear\).

This are the R Suave rules, but if a word doesn't met those ones **AND** also doesn't met the R Fuerte rules, you should use R Suave.  
  
Example: Partir, Fuerte, etc.
