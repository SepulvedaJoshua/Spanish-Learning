# Pronunciation Rules

## "R" Fuerte y "R" Suave \(Strong "R" and Soft "R"\)

### R Fuerte

"R fuerte" is a phoneme strongly used in Spanish, to pronounce it, you have to move your tongue back, stick it to the upper palate and blow, we also reference it grammatically with "erre / erres \(plural\)".  
  
You use R Fuerte when one of the following rules is met:

* The word starts with R \(Ex: Ratón\)
* The word has 2 Rs \(Ex: Desarrollar\)
* The R comes after an N \(-nr-\), L \(-lr-\) or S \(-sr-\)
  * Examples: So**nr**isa \(Smile\), A**lr**ededor \(Around\), Di**sr**upción \(disruption\).

### R Suave

"R suave" is more easily to say, because you don't really have to force your tongue with this, also sounds very similar to ら、り、る、れ、ろ.   
  
Soft R is practically used when none of the R Strong rules are met, anyways, here's his rules:

* The R is at the end \(Ex: Parar -&gt; Stop\).
* The R has -ere-, -oro-, -iri-, -ara-, -uru- or some combinations or the above \(-iru-, -eru-, etc.\).
  * Examples: L**oro** \(Parrot\), Lámp**ara** \(Lamp\), P**era** \(Pear\).

This are the R Suave rules, but if a word doesn't met those ones **AND** also doesn't met the R Fuerte rules, you should use R Suave.  
  
Example: Partir, Fuerte, etc.

## L, LL & Y

In Spanish, we pronounce the "LL" like an "Y", this last can work like a consonant and vowel.  
"Y" sounds similar like Japanese や、じ、じゅ、いぇ、よ. Here's a chart:



| LL / Y | 日本語 |
| :--- | :--- |
| Lla / Ya | や |
| Lli / Yi | じ |
| Llu / Yu | じゅ \(can also use a いぇ pronunciation\) |
| Lle / Ye | じぇ |
| Llo / Yo | よ |

* Even if LL and Y are pronounced similar, this doesn't mean that you have to use it equally, there are words with LL and words with Y, for example, you can write Llave \(Key\) but you cannot write Yabe, because that word doesn't exists.
* If `Y` is used like an `"And"` connector **OR** it is at the end of the word, you pronounce it like an Spanish `"i"`
* When an L not accompanied by another L, it pronounces like a normal L \(like an English L\).

Here are some examples of L, LL and Y words with his translation and Japanese phoneme guide

| Spanish | English | With Japanese Phonemes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Llave | Key | ヤベ |
| Ladrillo | Brick | ラドリヨ |
| Inyección | Injection \(Vaccine\) | イヌジェクシオン |
| Yunque | Anvil | ユンケ |
| Ley | Law | レイ |

## Ñ Pronunciation

The Ñ pronunciation is very similar to にゃ、にぃ、にゅ、にぇ、にょ So I think it will not be difficult for you, anyway I will leave some exercises for the words with Ñ.

* First, you should practice saying Ña, Ñi, Ñu, Ñe, Ño. when you feel ready, try reading this words:

| Word | English | With Japanese Phonemes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ñandú | Rhea | ニャンヅ |
| Niño | Boy | ニニョ |
| Niña | Girl | ニニャ |
| Ñoño | Nerd | ニョニョ |

* Note: I think in Japanese there is no phoneme for "dú", so I put a "ヅ", but you can pronounce it as the "do" in English
