# Gramatical Rules

## Y and E conjunctions

When you link two words with an `and` in Spanish, you use `Y`, but in some cases you should use `E`depending of the next word. If the word next to the conjunction starts with an `i`, you use `e` instead `y`

| Correct | Incorrect | English |

| Es misterioso e interesante | Es misterioso y interesante | it's mysterious and interesting |
| Cocodrilos e hipopótamos | Cocodrilos y hipopótamos | Crocodiles and hippos |
| Perros y Gatos | Perros e Gatos | Dogs and Cats |

### O and U conjunctions

As the same as above, when you connect two words with `or`, you use `O` in Spanish, but depending of the word next to the connector, you should use `U` instead of `O` connector

| Correct | Incorrect | English |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ¿Eres estudiante o universitario? | ¿Eres estudiante u universitario? | Are you an student or academic? |
| ¿Son arañas u hormigas? | ¿Son arañas o hormigas? | Are they spiders or ants? |
| ¿Quieres pimienta u orégano?  | ¿Quieres pimienta o orégano? | Do you want pepper or oregano? |

#### Comments

* In Spanish we have the "y/o" or "y/u" which is the same as "and/or" .
* Pro Tip: If you have complications with Y and E or O and U rules, just change the word order :\)

## Accentuation Rules \(Medium Difficulty\)

#### First of all, this one is like Medium level of Spanish, if you are not prepared to detect accent or divide words into syllables, you can skip it :\)

There are four types of accentuated words:

* Aguda \(Accent in last syllable\)
* Grave \(Accent in the penultimate syllable\)
* Esdrújula \(Accent in the antepenultimate syllable\)
* Sobreesdrújula \(Accent in the antepenultimate syllable\)

In Spanish we accentuate some words with an accent mark, if you are not sure if a word has a accent mark \(in Spanish called "tilde"\) you should follow this rules:

1. First you have to separate the word into syllables, in this example we will use the word "Programación".
2. So when you separate the word \(in this case would be "Pro-Gra-Ma-Cion"\), you have to listen where is the voice is accentuated.
3. When you find the accentuation, you have to see if the word ends with an N, S or vowel.
4. In this case, the word Programación has the voice accentuation at the end and ends with an N, so it's an "aguda" word.
